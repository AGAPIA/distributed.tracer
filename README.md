Distributed Tracer
==================

Distributed version of RIVER. DRIVER can trace multiple testcases at a
time and log the resulting traces.

How to use it
-------------

        ./run.sh [binary-id] [runs] [cores] [benchmark-runs] [(no)rebuild] [(no)genetic]

                 binary-id = unique identification string of the benchmark binary
                 runs = number of testcases that are generated by base fuzzers
                 cores = number of tracer processes that run in parallel
                 benchmark-runs = number of repetitions for current benchmark
                 (no)rebuild = if "rebuild", node-river build is updated
                 (no)genetic = if "genetic", river.genetic component is enabled to enhance testcase quality
